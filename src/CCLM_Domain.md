Sensitivity of domain selection in COSMO-CLM Regional Model
============

This is a report on how domain selection of Regional Climate Model (RCM) will alter the forecast estimate. In order to investigate the domain selection impact on the model results, I designed the following procedure:

<ol>
<li> set-up the _Default_ run of CCLM over Europe (CCLM domain 4 grid points smaller than int2lm domain)</li>
<li> set-up 8 similar runs with the Default run but shifted  4 grid points to different directions(1. East, 2. North-East, 3. North, 4. North-West, 5. West, 6. South-West, 7. South, 8. South-East) with the nboundlines == 3 </li>
</ol>

Then the 



<ol>
<li> set-up the _Default_ run of CCLM over Europe (CCLM domain 10 grid points smaller than int2lm domain)</li>
<li> <li>
</ol>
